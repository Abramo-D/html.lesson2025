    I have been alive for four and a half centuries I am Immortal...

    Here we are, born to be kings
    We're the princes of the Universe
    Here we belong, fighting to survive
    In a world with the darkest powers

    "ha-yaaa"

    And here we are
    We're the princes of the Universe
    Here we belong, fighting for survival
    We've come to be the rulers of your world

    ahhhhhhhhh (Choir)

    I am immortal
    I have inside me blood of kings
    (ya) (ya)
    I have no rival
    No man can be my equal
    Take me to the future of your world

    Born to be kings
    Princes of the Universe
    Fighting and free
    Got your world in my hand
    I'm here for your love and I'll make my stand
    We were born to be princes of the Universe

    No man could understand
    My power is in my own hand

    oohX3

    People talk about you
    People say you've had your day

    I'm a man that will go far
    Fly the moon and reach for the stars
    With my sword and head held high
    Got to pass the test first time, yeah

    I know the people talks about me I hear it every day
    But I can prove you wrong 'cause I'm right first time
    Yeah! Yeah! Alright! Let's go! Let's go!

    ha ha
    heyyy
    Watch this man fly
    woow
    Bring on the girls
    come onx3

    Here we are,(here we are) born to be kings
    We're the princes of the Universe
    Here we belong, born to be kings
    Princes of the universe, fighting and free

    Got your world in my hand
    I'm here for your love and I'll make my stand
    We were born to be princes of the Universe
